# Projects_with_Pandas
  This repository showcases two distinct data analysis projects: Election Survey Analysis and Netflix Survey Analysis. Each project involves fundamental data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using the Pandas library in Python. 
  The Jupyter notebooks provided offer step-by-step insights into the analysis process, allowing you to explore survey datasets and uncover trends, preferences, and patterns. 
  These projects serve as practical examples of data analysis techniques and demonstrate the power of data-driven decision-making.
